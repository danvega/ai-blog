# Nuxt + Notion Blog

This is a blog template using Nuxt 3 and Notion. I am using this as an example on how to build a blog using Nuxt 3 and Notion. This is still a work in progress so take it as just an example.

Todo:

- Blog
  - /blog/id -> /blog/slug
- Notion Componets
  - add all components
- Nuxt 3
  - nuxt image
  - server api (clean up)
  - runtimeConfig: vs .env
  - error pages
  - loading page customization
